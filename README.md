#### Read and find something about:
- You you know what domain is? And what services DNS provides?
- What is IP address?
- What is web-server?
- What is HTTP?
- What is website?

#### ToDo's:
- Install text editor. I would recommend to start with [Visual Studio Code](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/) as it has all it takes. It is pain at the beginning but I consider good to struggle at the beginning! You can also go with [Sublime](https://www.sublimetext.com/), [Atom](https://atom.io/) and others if you feel like it.
- Create account on [GitHub](github.com). The page you're reading this at now.
- You will also need browser. I am comfortable with [Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/) but Firefox or Opera will do. Just not IE or Edge please!
